# Benchmarks

We investigate two benchmarks in the BLIMP paper; [SPEC CPU 2017](https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/) and the sample applications provided in the [Phoenix suite](https://github.com/kozyraki/phoenix). Each benchmark and the instructions to instrument, build, and run are provided herein.

Information on what to do with instrumented output is provided [here](https://github.com/dovedevic/blimp).
